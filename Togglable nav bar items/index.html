        <b>Course Relevance:</b> <br>
        Software Engineering, rooted in both Computer Science and Computer Engineering, offers two perspectives:
        Computer Science-first or Software Engineering-first. It encompasses the entire software lifecycle, aiming to
        create high-quality, reliable programs systematically. This involves using formal methods for specification,
        analysis, design, and evaluation. It demands scalable software development techniques, meeting timing, size, and
        security criteria within project budgets and deadlines. The field draws on analytical and descriptive tools from
        Computer Science and the rigor of Computer Engineering, ensuring trustworthiness in the systems developed by
        collaborative teams.

        Project Centric Learning (PCL) empowers students by allowing them to explore their interests and strengths. In
        addition to regular coursework, it introduces semester-long Engineering Design and Development courses to
        address real-world issues within domains like healthcare, agriculture, defense, and more. Students supplement
        their knowledge with online courses and faculty guidance, preparing them for a project-driven world. PCL fosters
        active, inquiry-based learning, transforming teachers into mentors. It engages students in tackling complex,
        open-ended questions and challenges, promoting higher-order thinking skills, moving beyond knowledge acquisition
        to analysis, design, and application, aligning with Bloom's Taxonomy categories. PCL equips students for success
        in a project-centric society.
